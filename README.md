# Google-All-Access-Clone
Making a Clone of Google All Access, mostly Front End.

I decided to do this because:
1) I love Google All Access and its simplistic design.  
2) For some extra experience.
3) For Fun.

This was not made to be responsive for mobile or anything under 900px ( like the Google All Access web app ).
