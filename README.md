This is a project I am doing for myself. Originally it started as a clone of Google All Access written in Angular (to learn), but now I am going to create my own svg logos / brand image and create my own music player.

Right now, these are the things that need to be done:

- Program songs to play, and also add mp3 files to in-app database.
- Finish building interface for each page
- Create logo for 'E-Player' (E stands for Eddie, so Eddie player basically)
- Craft out custom playlist
- Craft out homepage.
- Optimize for Cross-Browser compatibility
